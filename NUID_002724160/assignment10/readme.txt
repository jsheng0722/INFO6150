Build a weather forecasting application using REACT
    Yes
Display a 5-day weather forecast, showing high and low temperatures daily and an image for sunny/rainy/cloudy/snowy. Use fake, hard-coded data until youâ€™ve got everything rendering correctly.
    There is 5-day weather forecast with showing hign and low temperatures daily and an image which have 4 types as sunny/rainy/cloudy/snowy.
    And I use the data from https://openweathermap.org/.

Add the ability to click on a day and see its hourly forecast. You can maintain the current view in the top-level App state.
    I click on a day and it will see the hourlu forecast.

Add React Router to the project (npm install react-router) and add routes such that / shows the 5-day forecast, and /[name-of-day] shows the hourly forecast for a particular day.
    I do add React Router in index.js to make this work.

Sign up for a free API key from https://openweathermap.org/ (Links to an external site.)
    Yes. I fetch the api link from this website.

Fetch a real 5-day forecast, and feed that data into your app
    I think it's work good.
