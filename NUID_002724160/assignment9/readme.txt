1.Connect your previous node assignment to this assignment. Create a login
page. Use usernames and passwords created in last assignment to login
successfully. You donâ€™t have to create new user and password(sign up page).
You can manually enter the data in backend and verify that with frontend(i.e.,
Just create login page). Follow REST API folder hierarchy (Server.js should be
entry, router.js, controller.js, service.js, model.js). Refer the folder structure in
attached images.
    There are routes.js in routes file,
    service.js in services file,
    user.js in models file,
    controllerjs in comtrollers file.
    And I can login with mongodb userName and password which created on last assignment, and it login successfully.
    And the folder structure is same as attached images.

2. Create 4 pages using react components and react-router (Home, About-us,
Jobs, Contact) as shown in the lab. Make sure to follow separate folder
structure for every component.
    There are 4 pages Home.js, AboutUs.js,Jobs.js and Contact.js in components file. And all of them use Card.js.

3. Add a card component on each page giving detail about each page. (Similar to
the"complex_component_single.htm" example shown in the class and in
folder react scripts uploaded in files). Use react map() to create dynamic
component at least on one of the page.
    Card component which is Card.js, giving the detail about each page, and use map() to create dynamic component.

4. Feel free to use CSS and some additional text to make pages pretty.
    Some css use in component, and I change the css of nav.
    
5. Upload the assignment on git. Add Readme and gitignore(add node modules
in gitignore) and explain the assignment in readme properly. If readme and
gitignore is missing points will be deducted.
